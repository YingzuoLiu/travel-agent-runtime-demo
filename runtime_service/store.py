        Replaces the two separate commits `_mark_cancelled` used to issue
        (`update_run` then `append_event`) with a single compare-and-set,
        the same shape as `finalize_completed_run`. The eligibility check --
        `status IN ('queued', 'running') AND cancel_requested = 1` -- and
        the CANCELLED transition happen in the same UPDATE:

        - `status IN ('queued', 'running')` covers both call shapes this
          replaces: a run cancelled before it ever started running (still
          QUEUED) and a run cancelled at or after the execution boundary
          (still RUNNING, since only a successful `finalize_completed_run`
          ever moves a RUNNING row away from RUNNING).
        - `cancel_requested = 1` asserts the precondition every call site
          already relies on (each only calls this once it has confirmed
          `cancel_requested` is set); it also means a bare duplicate call
          before this method has flipped `status` away from QUEUED/RUNNING
          would still be caught if `cancel_requested` were ever 0 here,
          though that combination should not occur given the call sites.

        Every column other than `status`/`cancel_requested`/`completed_at`/
        `updated_at` is written exactly as it currently stands on `run`, so
        each existing call site's semantics survive unchanged: a
        before-start cancellation leaves the original request/thread-store
        state alone (the caller never overwrote `run.state`), while an
        after-execution-boundary cancellation carries over the
        just-computed result state (the caller set `run.state` to it before
        calling this) -- `output_message`/`validation_errors`/`error`/
        `attempt` follow whatever the caller set on `run`, matching
        `_mark_cancelled`'s previous full-row `update_run` semantics.

        If the UPDATE does not affect exactly one row -- already cancelled,
        already completed/failed by a concurrent finalize, or (defensively)
        not actually cancel-requested -- nothing else in this method runs:
        no `run.cancelled` event, no duplicate write, and `run` itself is
