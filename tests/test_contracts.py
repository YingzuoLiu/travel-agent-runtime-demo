"""Contract tests for `agent/contracts.py`.

Pydantic v2 does not preserve subclass-only fields when a field is merely
annotated with a base class and handed a subclass instance at runtime (see
`agent/contracts.py`'s `RuntimeResponse` docstring). These tests prove, for
this repository's installed Pydantic version, that the chosen fix --
parametrizing the generic `RuntimeResponse` with the concrete `AgentState`
type -- actually avoids that trap, instead of relying on manual inspection.
They also exercise the real production chain (RuntimeManager -> SQLite ->
API) to prove no Travel-specific field is lost along the way.
