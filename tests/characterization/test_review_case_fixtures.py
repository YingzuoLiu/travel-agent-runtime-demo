"""Golden characterization of the labeled review-workflow fixtures.

Wraps `eval/review_cases.json` (via `eval/review_runner.py`'s loader) and
locks the exact `WorkflowReviewResult` shape the orchestrator currently
produces for each case, after normalizing non-deterministic ids/timestamps/
durations with `canonicalize()`. This is a superset of what
`eval/review_runner.py` itself checks (expected finding *types* only): here
we lock the full structured findings/directives/evidence, not just their
type set, so a later refactor (e.g. ValidationFinding/ReviewFinding shape
changes) cannot silently change severity, evidence, or rule ids.
