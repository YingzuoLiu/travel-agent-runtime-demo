# `TraceEvent` and `utc_now` moved to `agent/contracts.py`: they are fully
# domain-agnostic (an event/reason/payload/timestamp log entry has nothing
# Travel-specific about it) and `BaseRuntimeState.execution_trace` needs
# `TraceEvent` as its field type. Keeping them here would force
# `agent/contracts.py` to import from `agent/state.py` for `TraceEvent`
# while `agent/state.py` imports `BaseRuntimeState` from
# `agent/contracts.py` -- a circular import. Every direct importer of
# `TraceEvent`/`utc_now` from this module has been repointed to
# `agent.contracts`; nothing is re-exported from here.
