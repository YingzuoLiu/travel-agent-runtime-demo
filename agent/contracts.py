"""Core, domain-agnostic runtime contracts.

Every domain runtime (Travel today, others in later phases) is expected to
build on this shared layer: a base state shape, a generic response
envelope, and a structural protocol describing what a runtime must be able
to do. This module must never import from a concrete domain module
(currently `AgentState`/`TravelPlan` in `agent/state.py`) -- domain modules
import from here, not the other way around. See `agent/state.py`'s module
docstring for why `TraceEvent`/`utc_now` live here instead of there.

    such as `RuntimeResponse[AgentState]` keeps `state`'s static type,
    JSON schema, and serialized output all pinned to `AgentState`. Pydantic
    v2 does not preserve subclass-only fields when a field is merely
    annotated with a base class and handed a subclass instance at runtime;
    binding the type parameter to the concrete class sidesteps that
    entirely instead of asking Pydantic to serialize "as seen at runtime".
